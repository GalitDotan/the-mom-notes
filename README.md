**Customer conversations, captured with clarity.**

The Mom Notes is a minimalistic, offline-capable web and mobile app that helps you log customer insights using the symbol system from Rob Fitzpatrick’s excellent book, [*The Mom Test*](https://momtestbook.com/).  

This app is designed to help founders, product teams, and researchers focus on what matters:  
- ⚡ Pain points  
- 🥅 Jobs to be done  
- ⭐ Follow-up tasks  
- And much more — all marked with quick, recognizable emoji signals.

## 🌍 Live App

## 🏗️ Hosting

The Mom Notes is built to be hosted and deployed on **Base44**, a no-code/low-code full-stack platform.  
Base44 manages both the backend (data, APIs, authentication) and the frontend (PWA delivery) so the app stays scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.

If you want to self-host, please note that you will need to:  
- Set up both the frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Node/Express or similar)  
- Provide your own database, authentication system, and hosting infrastructure  
- Adapt the codebase away from Base44 dependencies

For most users, we recommend keeping it on Base44 for maximum stability and ease.
