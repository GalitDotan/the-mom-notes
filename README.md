# The Mom Notes

**Customer conversations, captured with clarity.**

The Mom Notes is a minimalistic, offline-capable web and mobile app that helps you log customer insights using the symbol system from Rob Fitzpatrick’s excellent book, [*The Mom Test*](https://momtestbook.com/).

- ⚡ Pain points  
- 🥅 Jobs to be done  
- ⭐ Follow-up tasks  
- And much more — all marked with quick, recognizable emoji signals.
